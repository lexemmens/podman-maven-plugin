* ([#26](https://github.com/lexemmens/podman-maven-plugin/pull/26)) Introduced `pull` option in build configuration to control whether an image should be pulled. [More information](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-image-pulling). Thanks to [Christopher J. Uwe](https://github.com/cruwe).

### 1.3.0 (18-11-2020)
#### Improvements
* When debug is enabled, Podman version information will now be printed.

#### Bugs
* Passwords that contained special characters were not always properly obfuscated

### 1.2.2 (28-10-2020)
#### Bugs
* Set the default run directory to the root of the current module instead of the root of the Maven project.

### 1.2.1 (28-10-2020)
#### Bugs
* Allow configuration of the directory where the Podman command is executed. This defaulted to the target directory, which is not always convenient.

### 1.2.0 (28-10-2020)
#### Improvements
* Introduced a flag called `failOnMissingContainerFile` that prevents that the plugin fail throw an exception in case no Containerfile is present in a Maven module. This may be useful
for projects that use this plugin as part of a profile where a `Containerfile` is not always in the same location

### 1.1.0 (16-10-2020)
#### Bugs
* Fixed an issue that required the `CleanMojo` to have a valid ImageConfiguration. This is not necessary since only the custom root storage location needs to be configured for this Mojo to work.

### 1.0.0 (20-10-2020)
#### Improvements
* Renamed `Docker` to `Container` to be in line with Podman's naming conventions. This is a breaking change, please update your configuration.
* Added basic support for multistage `Containerfile`s. Please refer to documentation for the exact configuration.
 
### 0.9.0 (22-09-2020)
#### Improvements
* Added configuration of the `--runroot` setting, which is used by Podman to store its state information.

### 0.8.0 (xx-09-2020)
#### Improvements
* Added clean phase that allows cleaning up the local storage. This only works when the root storage location is configured in the pom file to prevent accidentally deleting unrelated files.

### 0.7.0 (26-06-2020)
#### Bugs
* Fixed a NullPointerException that occurred when no image configuration was present in the pom. A normal exception with more information is now raised instead.

#### Improvements
* Added possibility to build container images with docker manifest and configuration data (`podman build --format=<oci/docker>` equivalent).

### 0.6.1 (05-06-2020)
#### Bugs
* Fixed a `NullPointerException` that could occur when no `<podman/>` configuration was specified. 

### 0.6.0 (04-06-2020)
#### Improvements
* Added option to set a custom root directory when running Podman (equivalent of running `podman --root=/some/custom/directory`)

### 0.5.0 (29-05-2020)
#### Bugs
* Labels were not always added on a new line
* Labels after an `ENTRYPOINT` command were sometimes ignored. Labels are now put on the line after the base image declaration (`FROM` command)

#### Improvements
* Documentation no longer states that this plugin is **not** in Maven Central. 

### 0.4.0 (28-05-2020)
#### Bugs
* Podman used the wrong base dir for building container images
* When TLS Verify is not set, this sometimes caused an '... takes only 1 argument' error, due to an empty subcommand being passed.

#### Improvements
* Changed the log line that says 'Initializing image configurations.' to debug.
* Explicitly set `dockerFileDir` to value of `${project.baseDir}` rather then `new File(".")`

### 0.3.0 (27-05-2020)
#### Bugs
* AuthenticationService now checks the default credential file based on the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable
* When TLS Verify is not set, it will no longer be used when running Podman commands.
* When Podman login failed, the password of the user was printed in the error message

#### Improvements
* Moved authentication to the different Mojo's, such that `skipBuild`, `skipPush`, `skipSave` can be configured separately. 

### 0.2.1 (26-05-2020)
#### Security
* Removed accidental publication of passphrase. Tag 0.2.0 has therefore been removed from Github.

### 0.2.0 (26-05-2020)
#### Improvements
* Refactored the iamge build configuration for more flexibility

#### New features
* Added noCache support when buildig images
* Added support for labels. Labels are metadata and will be appended to the source Dockerfile before running a build

_NOTE:_ This release is not compatible with 0.1.0. Due to the early stages of development you must reconfigure your plugin in the `pom.xml`

### 0.1.0 (24-05-2020)
Initial implementation released
